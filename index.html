        <p> I am a student at The University of Georgia studying Computer Science with a minor in General Business, currently on pace to graduate in the fall of 2025. 
            I have worked as a corporate communications intern so I work very well when required to communicate with a team to effectively plan a course of action as well as work with supervisors and other teams to ensure that the most efficient solution is implemented.
            I have also worked in the retail industry before so I understand very well how to work with a team under pressure of time constraints without sacrificing quality of work/ services. 
            I am looking for internship positions in software development/ the cybersecurity industry. 
            I am always striving to learn more and I am driven by my passion to help others, analytical skills, and willingness to collaborate.</p>
